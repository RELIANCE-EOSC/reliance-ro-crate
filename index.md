_RELIANCE RO-Crates_ are a specialization of [_RO-Crate_](https://researchobject.github.io/ro-crate/) for packaging data cubes enabling access earth observation data, along with all the necessary and other related artifacts like documentation, images, related infrastructures, etc.  

RELIANCE project uses _RELIANCE RO-Crates_ as an exchange format to package data cubes in Earth Science.


## Concepts

This section uses terminology from the [RO-Crate 1.1 specification](https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.1).

### Context

The _Crate_ JSON-LD MUST be valid according to [RO-Crate 1.1](https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.1) and SHOULD use the RO-Crate 1.1 `@context` <https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.1/context>

### Metadata File Descriptor

The [Metadata File Descriptor](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/1.1/root-data-entity.html#ro-crate-metadata-file-descriptor) `conformsTo` SHOULD be an array that contains at least <https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.1>.

## RELIANCE RO-Crate Description

A RELIANCE RO-Crate MAY  include at least one Data Cube Data Entity, which MUST have the following properties:

- @type: MUST be ***DataCubeCollection*** or ***DataCubeProduct***.
- @id: MUST be either a URI Path relative to the RO Crate root, or an absolute URI, which can point to a file with the data cube or to a Web service call that allows generating the data cube on demand.

### DataCube Data Description

A DataCube Data Entity MAY include the following properties:

- @contentLocation: MUST be the id of a Contextual Entity of type Place.
- @temporalCoverage: MUST be a temporal range specified as a period (e.g., 2011/2013).

A DataCube Data Entity MUST include the following properties:

- @reliance:spatialCoverage: MUST be the id of a Contextual Entity that identifies the spatial coverage in detail, including rel:extent (expressed as a WKT text), rel:spatial-step-resolution and rel:coordinate-reference-system.
- @reliance:temporalCoverage: MUST be the id of a Contextual Entity that identifies the temporal coverage in detail, including rel:beginningTime (expressed as ISO8601), rel:endTime (expressed as ISO8601), rel:temporal-step-resolution and rel:temporal-reference-system-unit.  

A DataCube Entity MAY include the following property:

- @verticalCoverage: MUST be the id of a Contextual Entity that identifies the vertical coverage in detail, including rel:highestValue, rel:lowestValue, rel:vertical-step-resolution and rel:vertical-reference-system-unit.

A DataCube Data Entity SHOULD include the properties:

- sch:name
- sch:description
- sch:keywords (already discussed in the general layer for RO-Crate)
- sch:contentSize  
- sch:encodingFormat
- sch:contactPoint

A DataCube Data Entity MAY include the properties:

- reliance:product-type
- reliance:product-version
- reliance:data-type
- reliance:data-type-unit
- reliance:processing-level
- reliance:processor
- reliance:instrument
- reliance:platform
- reliance:other-data-acquisition-system
- reliance:dataquality
- reliance:maxValue
- reliance:minValue
- reliance:maxDate
- reliance:minDate
- reliance:noDataValue
- reliance:links-to-resources

### Software Description

In what relates to the software description, the following will be included as a Data Entity. A RELIANCE RO-Crate MAY include one or more Software Data Entities, which MUST have the following properties:

- @type: MUST be Software.
- @id: MUST be either a URI Path relative to the RO Crate root, or an absolute URI, which can point to a file with the software, to a DOI with the software or to a Web address of the repository of the software.

A Software Data Entity SHOULD include the following properties (besides the Data Cube Entity properties):

- sch:name
- sch:description
- sch:license
- sch:softwareVersion
- sch:author
- sch:codeRepository
- cm:referencePublication

A Software Data Entity MAY include the following properties:

- cm:buildInstructions
- sch:programmingLanguage
- sch:runtimePlatform
- sch:downloadURL
- sch:operatingSystem
- sch:memoryRequirements
- sch:preocessorRequirements
- sch:publisher
- cm:readme

### Versioning Research Objects Description

A RELIANCE RO-Crate MAY include the following properties (from the RO-Evo ontology):

- roevo:archivedAtTime, which represents the release date of the Research Object.
- roevo:snapshotedAtTime, which represents the snapshot date of the Research Object.
- eop:status, which MUST have any of the following values: liveRO, forkedRO, snapshotRO or archivedRO.
- roevo:wasArchivedBy, which MUST point to a Contextual Entity of type Person.
- roevo:wasSnapshotedBy, which MUST point to a Contextual Entity of type Person.

Other properties from the RO-Evo ontology MAY be also included, following that ontology.
